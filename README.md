# PlaugeOfTheUndead
This is the game I created for my NPA SCQF 6 Games Design class.

## Tools
- Engine = [Unity](https://unity.com/)
- Language = [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
- 3D Modles = [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
- 2D Sprites = [Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/)
- IDE = [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) & [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)

Please note I couldn't go overboard and was restricted by the course outline and rules.

## Keys
- `WASD` = Movement
- `Space` = Jump
- `E` = Use
- `Q` = Switch Weapon
- `F` = Open Chest
- `Mouse Left` = Hit
- `Mouse` = Move Camera

## Aim of the game
- Kill zombies to increase XP and gain coins, once you have received enough XP you can progress to the next level (you must find the portal first). You can use coins to purchase new and better weapons.
- Chests will drop consumables and coins.
- **MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH COINS TO PURCHASE WEAPONS AT THE START OF EACH LEVEL, YOUR WEAPONS WILL BE WIPED**
- Bit of a spoiler but might be needed - On the first level, the portal is within the trees North West of the big tree facing right of the large graveyard.
